Drupal 8 Theme  

(with thanks to [Andrei Zvonkov](https://github.com/zetagraph/monoset) for the basic idea of the single page theme, much-corrupted since!)

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Gulp.js - Install gulp globally with `$ npm install gulp-cli -g`  

## Installation
- CD into the theme directory and run $ npm install to fetch all dependencies.
- For BrowserSync update proxy server in gulpfile.js to match your local environment.
- CD into the theme directory and run “npx gulp” to use the *locally* installed `gulp` to start watching changed file; compiling; and Browser Syncing.
